# HackerRank-Solutions

HackerRank is a technology company that focuses on competitive programming challenges for both consumers and businesses, where developers compete by trying to program according to provided specifications. HackerRank's programming challenges can be solved in a variety of programming languages (including Java, C++, PHP, Python, SQL, JavaScript) and span multiple computer science domains.

Initially, I want to point out a situation that I am not a pro-programmer! I'm adding these solutions for everyone who wants to be benefited, including me! These are my solutions for problems from HackerRank. I'll try to add more and solutions gradually. Also, I kept it open for all. So, you can obviously commit or fork it out. Sometimes, as much I have experienced, we all need help to find solution of a particular problem or we want to check other avialable solutions to find the most efficient one. I am not saying that these are the most efficient solutions, but I hope these solutions will help you out in some way. Also, I'll be honored if you suggest another algorithm to solve a particular problem. So, each of your commit will help other programmers. Happy coding!
